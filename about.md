# Hi there!

We are GhostLineSecurity :)
A research group dedicated to investigate, develop and learn about the (so) many interesting fields of cyber-security. 

This static, weird looking, simplistic yet readable, blog has been created with only one thing in mind: Sharing what we learned.

Expect technical and, sometimes even, interesting articles to be periodically posted here.

## Where do we belong?

GhostLineSecurity represents the most technical, and new, branch of Áudea, a company focused on the GRC/legal aspects of cyber security. Until now.

As strange as it seems for a compliance company (·_.), Áudea happened to keep a very open mind regarding what __dealing__ with our kind is. Let's face it: We're not the easiest people to work with.

They were happy for us to invest time on R+D, learn new stuff, talk about it... And most importantly, they gave us the tools in no time to achieve it.

GhostLineSecurity is a part of the new department we're working to create at Áudea.
